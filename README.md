- Add Nav To:
  - about.html
  - bonus.html
  - contact.html
  - novels.html
  - short-stories.html
  - music-cutm.html

### Novels

- Fix hover link for testimonial citations. (Underline appears, then drops 1px.)
- Mobile responsiveness: Remove animation delays for TESTIMONIALS for media queries where these divs are stacked in a column.

### Short Stories

- Fix hover link for testimonial citations. (Underline appears, then drops 1px.) Only Jon's does not do this for some reason.

### Bonus

- Get bg still image working correctly.
  - Reintegrate error message when video doesn't play.
- Custom-design pages for the following, and set MailChimp to route users there instead:
  - Signup Thank You Page. (Video background.)
  - Confirmation Thank You Page. (Video background.)

### Contact

- Switch to PHP?

### All

- HTML:
  - Add `<cite>` tags around each instance of my project titles.
- Style h1, h2, etc. for master CSS.
- Footer:
  - Test mobile responsiveness.

### Music

- Style hover effects and hyperlink underlines.
  - MAKE ALBUM TITLES UNDERLINED AGAIN.
- Make artist names h2. (PROBLEM: <summary> tag is preventing this.)
- Make album titles h3.
- Make song titles h4.
- The Druggist Music:
  - See if you can adjust the background image alignment.

### Mobile Responsiveness:

- index.html
- about.html
- bonus.html
- contact.html
- novels.html
- short-stories.html
- music-cutm.html
- music-druggist.html

### Screenplays

- Have one page for all screenplays. Each section is 100vh and contains a link to the PDF for that script (pending Mark -- and in some cases Dave's -- approval).
- Some sort of background artwork that I will probably have to commission.
- Image of script's title page slides in from the left.
- Synopsis on the left.
- "Henchmen Wanted" section will also have embedded video of "Expendable."
- Make mobile responsive.

### Cleanup

- Delete animate.css file when finished.
- Delete app.js and remove any unused links to it if it is unused.
- Delete waypoint.js and remove any unused links to it if it is unused.
- Remove any Google Font links you don't wind up using. (Streamline load time.)

### Deployment

- Run linters.
- Dreamhost:
  - Delete all contents of current website's directory.
  - Add all new files from scratch.
- Test MailChimp.
- Test Contact form.
- Sent to family and friends.
- Announce on social media.
