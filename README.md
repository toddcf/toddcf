### Index

### Music

- The Druggist Music:
  - See if you can fix the background image alignment.
- Style hover effects and hyperlink underlines.
  - MAKE ALBUM TITLES UNDERLINED AGAIN.
  - And make sure to "cascade" the code in a way that it's not adding and subtracting these features back and forth.
- Change opacity transition to a brightness transition.
- Make artist names h2. (PROBLEM: <summary> tag is preventing this.)

- Make song titles h4.
- Make mobile responsive.

### Bonus
