## Future Iterations

### Footer

- The footer.js file is linked, but there are jQuery issues that need to be fixed before it will push the date to HTML.
- The ABOUT page is the only one with the correct &ndash; layout. Bring the other HTML pages up to speed.

### Bonus

- Footer:
  - Debug: I think the MailChimp AWS link is creating some sort of problem for my footer.js file, as it is not displaying the current year.
- Get bg still image working correctly.
  - Reintegrate error message when video doesn't play.
- Make mobile responsive.
- Custom-design pages for the following, and set MailChimp to route users there instead:
  - Signup Thank You Page.
  - Confirmation Thank You Page.

- Make mobile responsive.

### All

- HTML:
  - Add `<cite>` tags around each instance of my project titles.
- Style h1, h2, etc. for master CSS.
- Remove any Google Font links you don't wind up using. (Streamline load time.)
- Link favicon.
- Footer:
  - Set all ABOUT links in footer, once those pages are ready.
  - Test mobile responsiveness.
- Nav:
  - Add nav to every page except INDEX.HTML.
  - Drops down when scrolling down.
  - Mobile responsive: Links collapse into icon.

### Index

- Activate links (once those pages are ready).
- Make mobile responsive.

### Music

- The Druggist Music:
  - See if you can fix the background image alignment.
- Style hover effects and hyperlink underlines.
  - MAKE ALBUM TITLES UNDERLINED AGAIN.
  - And make sure to "cascade" the code in a way that it's not adding and subtracting these features back and forth.
- Make artist names h2. (PROBLEM: <summary> tag is preventing this.)
- Make album titles h3.
- Make song titles h4.
- Make mobile responsive.

### Screenplays

- Have one page for all screenplays. Each section is 100vh and contains a link to the PDF for that script (pending Mark -- and in some cases Dave's -- approval).
- Some sort of background artwork that I will probably have to commission.
- Image of script's title page slides in from the left.
- Synopsis on the left.
- "Henchmen Wanted" section will also have embedded video of "Expendable."
- Make mobile responsive.

### Cleanup

- Delete animate.css file when finished.
