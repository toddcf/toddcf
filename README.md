# Todd Croak-Falen
## Author Website
Official website for author Todd Croak-Falen. Books include:
* Catch Up To Myself
* The Druggist

## Future Iterations

The MVP version of this site is the home page only. This features a carousel that slides between the cover art of my books. Each image is a link to the book's Amazon page. There is also a Facebook icon in the footer that links to my author Facebook page. This was enough to allow me to take down my old site and replace it with this. Upcoming iterations include:

* Improve mobile responsiveness. (Specifically centering the FB logo when the height of the footer changes, and fixing the synopsis div on the CUTM page.)
* A page for "Catch Up To Myself," which the carousel will link to instead of Amazon. (The Amazon link will be on the "Catch Up To Myself" page.)
* A page for "The Druggist," which the carousel will link to instead of Amazon. (The Amazon link will be on "The Druggist" page.)
* A page for my "Henchmen Wanted" screenplay, which will include an embedded Vimeo of the short film version, "Expendable."
* Contact page with a form so fans can send me emails.
* "About" page.
* Add navbar to navigate between these different pages on the site.
* A Bonus Content page, complete with a signup form for my email list (via MailChimp).
* A popup modal inviting people to the Bonus Content page.
