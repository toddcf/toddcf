						<p>I figure if you came to my About page, you're looking for something a little deeper than the one-paragraph bio you saw in one of my books. So here it is, in my own words.</p>

						<p>When I look back on it, I realize that reading and writing have always held an undeniable pull for me. I began writing little books in first grade, stapling the pages together into a spine. For Christmas in second grade, I asked for (and received) a book on how to write cursive so I could teach myself. I didn't want to wait until third grade to learn. Back then, I was just following my instincts without much question. I now have the perspective to realize that these things were unusual, and say a lot about me as a person.</p>

						<p>The summer after I completed middle school, my family moved from Altadena, California to Portland, Oregon. I was excited, but there was still a month or two before school started, and I didn't yet have other ways of meeting people. I spent a lot of time alone in my room. Every morning, painters would wake me up at 7:00 am as they set up their ladders against a nearby house. And so would begin another day of stifling boredom.</p>

						<p>I soon decided to write a YA novel not only to entertain myself, but to have something to show for my time. It was called <span class="italic">Snow Aces</span>, and was about two best friends in middle school who had adventures sledding down the hills of their neighborhood and doing battle with a local bully, whose sister the main character had a crush on. I cranked out some good pages, but ultimately got stuck after several chapters.</p>

						<p>It wasn't until halfway through high school that I began work on a new novella, <span class="italic">Kevin</span>. I was once again sitting at home, bored, when I randomly decided to create a more interesting world to escape into. I had no idea where the story was going, and I certainly wasn't working off an outline&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I just made everything up as I went along. Whatever I decided would make the current scene more interesting, I threw in.</p>
